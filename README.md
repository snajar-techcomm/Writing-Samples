# ABOUT ME
I have over a decade of combined translation and technical communication experience in the financial services, medical device manufacturing, and language services industries, including:
-	Localization of technical content,
-	Evangelizing content source optimization,
-	Leading documentation projects, 
-	Language project management, and
-	Terminology management.

In my recent role, I created a comprehensive set of language management documentation that contained a product naming convention, program charter, standard operating procedures, style guides, and work instructions. I also proofread and sometimes substantively edited English “instructions for use” and user manuals to ensure clarity, compliance with regulatory guidelines, and translation readiness. In addition, I led the drafting of a request for proposal to source new language service providers.

Since 2022, I have been the Education and Content Lead for Women in Localization, a nonprofit organization for the advancement of women and the localization industry. In working with this global community, I have added to my professional skill set through coordinating virtual educational events, writing instructional content for community volunteers, and collaborating with team members to create general content for freelance translators.
